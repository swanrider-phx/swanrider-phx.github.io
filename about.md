			<p>Tauheeda’s vision is to serve abused victims and families fleeing violent situations with the need to rehabilitate their lives.</p>
			<p>Once a victim of domestic violence herself, Tauheedah has committed her life to helping other victims of abuse.  Tauheedah has spent 8 years volunteering to support victims and survivors of domestic violence.  She has attended hours of training to help better understand the dynamics of domestic violence and how to be an empowering advocate.  This includes continuing education through Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence and Maricopa Association of Governments. <a class="read-more" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tj-info">Read More</a></p>

				<p>She has been a member of Speaker’s Bureau at AZCESDV through victim impact statements.  Tauheedah has spoken throughout the greater Phoenix area to students, judges, healthcare providers, Florence Prisons, Maricopa County Integrate Health Systems, Arizona State Capitol, local businesses and churches.  She has volunteered and served on many committees to organize community awareness events focused on domestic violence.
				Tauheedah’s passion to serve the victims of domestic comes from her personal experience when she escaped her abuser-husband in 1993.  Traveling from Atlanta, GA with 8 of her 9 children, she fled on a Greyhounds bus and arrived in Phoenix, Arizona with only 53 cents in her pocket.</p>
				<p>She worked tirelessly with 2-3 jobs at a time to provide for her children and often in the face of hunger or looming bills.  Tauheedah was evicted twice and eventually had to resort to leaving her youngest children with trusted friends for 5 weeks as she struggled to find a new home for her family.  During this time she lived in a van with her older daughter, parking undetected in the parking lot of her more recent job at Home Depot many nights.  In the morning she would wake up before dawn to use the facilities and clean up for her work day.</p>
				<p>In 2007 Tauheedah was presented the Courage of Conviction award from the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.  The Courage of Conviction award is given by the coalition to acknowledge the contributions of any person who best exemplifies the mission “To lead, to advocate, to educate, to collaborate, to end domestic violence in Arizona” and the person receiving this award would demonstrate the following characteristics:</p>
