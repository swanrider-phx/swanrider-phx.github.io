			<h4>Support Group</h4>
			<p>We provide group sessions where facilitators give women information and education about domestic violence.

The group focuses on empowerment and healing.</p>

			<h4>Teens and Tweens</h4>
			<p>Most families who seek help from SWAN arrive with nothing beyond the clothes they are wearing.  This is extremely difficult with teenagers.  Young children are entertained with toys and coloring books, but teenagers are typically missing phones, tablets and video games.  They are also missing their friend privacy of their own space.  We try to assist the needs of our teenagers with gift cards to get a coffee or a dinner out.</p>
			<p>Resources Needed:  Games, laptops, tablets, gift cards, makeup</p>

			<p>Resources Needed:  Printing materials, education booklets</p>
