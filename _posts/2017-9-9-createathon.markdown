<p>This site was put together during an event called CreateAthon AZ 2017, a 24 hour event where creative individuals are put together into teams to help various nonprofits throughout Arizona. SWAN is a small but determined grassroots organization that helps those in need. Our goal for the event was to help SWAN reach a larger audience of people by giving them an updated website and providing some other materials. Take a look around the site to find out more!</p>
