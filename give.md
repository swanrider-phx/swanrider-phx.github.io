			<p>"I volunteered for Swan Rider in July of 2017 through a 24-hour hackathon to help develop their website and marketing content.  It was an incredible experience because of the opportunity to meet Tauheedah and her team.  They are incredibly selfless and their passion for service was inspiring for me as a volunteer.  Seeing how much they care made me want to give more and I’m proud to have partnered with them."</p>
