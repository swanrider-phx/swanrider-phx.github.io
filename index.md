			<i>"This program has helped my family a lot.  We needed furniture, so they provided us with 3 twin beds, a crib and other household things such as curtains, sheets, hygiene stuff and a toaster oven because we didn’t have a stove and much more.  These ladies were truly a blessing and they did all they could and more.  I would recommend them to any family I know in need, thanks and God Bless."</i>
